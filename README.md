# Energia Malgrat Web

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

We try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with just the scaffolding we set up for you, and add additional things later when they become necessary.

If you are not familiar with the different technologies used in this project, please refer to the respective docs. If you still are in the wind, please join our [Discord](https://t3.gg/discord) and ask for help.

### Prompts

Generate a web for a local association related to share solar energy between local people. The content should be in Catalan language (spanish region for formatting units, dates and times). For start it should has a basic layout with navigation bar in the header with the pages Inici, Projectes, Agenda, Contacte. The web should support light and dark theme with a icon in the header to switch it. I attached the logo that should appear in the left on the header. When the basic layout is created I would like to focus on the Agenda page which should contain a list of events as Cards in a column style. The event card will have a title, description, start date and time, the duration, location, a button to open external
